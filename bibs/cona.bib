longcomment={
Baecher model of either exponential or lognormally distributed
fracture radii produces lognormally distributed traces; 
Veneziano's Possion plane model produces exponentially
distributed traces as parts of the planes are removed
randomly. Further discussion identifies an unbounded 
100\% persistent Veneziano model versus a bounded 
model.  A 100\% bounded model is equivalent to Baecher?
Dershowitz model also extends Veneziano model, see also 
Dershowitz PhD dissertation.  The primary 
objectives of the paper seems to be describing {\em
joint system models} primarily illustrating the Baecher,
Veneziano and Dershowitz models and presenting speculative concepts
using Mosaic Block tesselation for model joint systems. 
Also, they define two separate approaches to describe
an assemblage of geometric joint characteristics:
the disaggregate method, where each joint characteristic
such as orientation, spacing, etc. is described separately
using distributions, and the aggregate, or joint system model
that describes the interdepence of joint characteristics.},

longcomment={Odling investigates connectivity of fracture networks by
analyzing the structure of fracture clusters with respect to 
fracture density.  He analyzes 2-D networks traced on bedding
planes, Mauldon's bias and interlayer effect are not treated.
Fracture density is defined as fracture trace length per unit area
$P_{22}$.
A fracture ``cluster'' is defined as a group of connected fracture
traces, but no illustrative example is given.  
Odling points out that the number of intersections is less than
the number of fractures, but that both increase at the same rate,
which increases the number of connections (intersections)
per fracture.  Notes that `T' junctions appear to be independent 
of fracture density. Models flow in connected fracture ``backbones;''
notes that majority of flow takes place along backbone.  Does not
quantify majority.  Notes that 3-D data is difficult to obtain,
but bed-normal permeability for confined fractures should be applicable
to extend this work.
Concludes that extracting the backbone is most important for
modeling flow, and may lessen computational difficulties.},

cross the entire flow domain is very small.
Also, the comments on page 133-136 are completely 
analogous to interlayer type permeability: 
...[3 large aperture fractures] {\em are scattered
through out the system and surrounded by narrower 
aperture segments {\rm (fractures)}, the effecton total
flow will be small. And the aperture parameters which do 
not take fracture location into account will be indentical

are useless in any network where fracture location

comment={Basically a short literature review.  Some results
are presented from Maini's work; probably from his dissertation.
The biggest point seems to be that modeling fluid flow through
actual rock fractures was not considered to be very easy in 
1972, which is pretty much still the case in 1985.  Good
reference for early work on work with fracture roughness and flow.
Probably the best way to review this paper would be to create
a list of observations and results.},

comment={{\em My copy of this paper is a Mauldon
xerox; text is cut off at the edges from copying.}
Assumes fracture location follows a Poisson 
process with mean spacing $\Delta$.  Uses the analogy
with microbes in a water droplet, which is later used 
by P. J. Pahl, who attributes the analogy and subsequent 
derivation to Wicksell (1920's?).  Snow declines to prove the 
validity of the Poisson approximation, which is later 
taken by Priest, I think 1976.   Snow derives fracture
porosity $\theta$ from the permeability $k$ and
average fracture spacing $\Delta$.  Implicitely assumes
fracture spacing and aperture is independent.  The theory
is applied to grouting in undisturbed rock around
dam sites.

There is an interesting note in the acknowledgments:
The manuscript typing, computer card punching (programming?),
and figure drafting were done by three other people!},
