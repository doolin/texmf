comment={This formulation is essentially finite element.  The
equations are derived in terms of nodal displacements rather than
deformation.  Four advantages of DDA formulation are presented,
of which 3 and 4 (specifically) appear equivocal. The author states
in 3 that DDA has no contact overlap (thus allowing fluid flow
simulation).  This seems to contradict the premise of the penalty
method.  In 4, the author states that existing FEM codes may be
converted easily to DDA codes.  However, the author presented
an FEM code, not a DDA code, so the claim appears unsupported.},

formulation by: (1) incorporating more accurate rigid body rotations;

MacLaughlin also compared DDA results with the analytical solutions
for a single block sliding on an inclined plane, two or more
 blocks on a biplanar failure surface, and blocks on a circular
failure surface. DDA matched the analytic results well for
the single block model, but multiple block models were found to be
analytically overconservative.},

comment ={In a set of companion papers,
Wang and Garga and Garga and Wang
develop an apparently independent
block system model identical to Shi's DDA.
They use the model to investigate rock bolts and pore
water pressure effects on excavations in blocky rock masses,
reporting good agreements with observed field behavior.
Their pore pressure formulation is static, and the block
system does not support isolated blocks (i.e. ``free fall'').
As of this paper,
Wang's method appears to be relatively simple.  It handles kinematic
instabilities and pore pressure.  The model is limited to rigid,
undeformable blocks, does not handle free-fall of blocks, assumes a
linear rotation angle without explaining the implicit assumtion that
the rotations are small.},

comment ={Yeung investigated the mechanics of a
single block on an incline, numerically solved an equation of
motion for a three hinged beam and investigated rock bolt
interaction in mine roofs.  The single block model showed that
dynamic equilibrium should be considered in the mode of behavior
of a block system, that is, whether sliding or sliding and
toppling occur.  The three hinged beam problem showed that
DDA can be dependent on the size of the time step, larger time
steps proved unconservative.  },
