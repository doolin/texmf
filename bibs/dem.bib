The fracture system was modeled as a collection of pipes

to vary over time.  A weakness of the model allowed blocks 
to overlap.  This model is probably not useful for slope

of contact detection aspect and a contact interaction aspect.  
The main problem discussed by the authors is that 
for 3D discrete elementproblems, the angular velocity describing the rotation 
about the center of mass does not coincide with the principal
axes of the discrete element.  However, the authors do not 
define the "principal axes of the discrete element" before they 
describe the problem.  My guess is that would have to be the
principal axes of either the inertia tensor or the Euler 
tensor.  The authors point out the lack (to their 
knowledge) of robust and accurate numerical algorithms for 
transient analysis of large numbers of discrete elements. 
The paper proposes a fourth-order explicit RK scheme for 
3D discrete elements.  The accuracy of the algorithm is 
controlled by the size of the time step.

Two reference frames are introduced: 1. An {\em inertial frame}, 
which is cartesianal, and tracks the centroid of the discrete element; 2. 
An {\em element frame} with an origin coinciding to 
the center of mass of the element, which moves with the center of
mass of the element and may rotate freely about the centroid.  The
inertial frame is also cartesian (because of rigid body?) and
the axes are assumed to be parallel to the inertia tensor of 
the element.

Time steps are assumed small enough such that the
angular velocity $\omega$ may be assumed constant
during the time step $h$.  Constant angular velocity 
implies that the discrete element rotates about a 
fixed axis during the time interval (Prove this, 
or at least exlain it to myself).  Eqs. 32-39 are 
key.  The authors note that the total external moment
on the discrete element is approximated as a sum of 
impulse loads acting at certain times (Fig. 2).  The 
RK scheme is derived termwise, then presented in 
Eq. 54.  The authors do not assess the stability of 
the scheme.  The examples show period growth increasing 
with time step value.

The paper is pretty good overall, very clearly written,
and the formulas and algorithms are well presented.
Assessing the value of the coordinate system/RK 
scheme will be much easier using geometrical notation,
and doing some spectral analysis of the integration 
scheme.}
