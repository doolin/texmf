comment={Uses log-normal joint diameters to model trace lengths
observed in the field (at an Australian mine?). Assumes circular 
joints oriented normal to observation (trace) plane, 30 mm lower
limit resolution.  Compares field data with synthetic data.  Two 
main results: \begin{enumerate}
\item $\sigma$ of traces $> \sigma$ of synthetic data. \item
As $\sigma$ of synthetic data increases, the mean chord (trace)
length ultimately are larger than themean diameter, a result
of sampling bias: the probability of intersecting a large disk
(circular fracture) is greater than the probability of intersecting 
a smaller disk. This means that that there is no {\em constant}
weighting factor applicable for correctig estimates of joint sizes
with log-normal diameters.   Unfortunately, Barton provides no 
details of his modeling scheme.
\end{enumerate}},

comments={Elliptical, anastomosing tubes with a fractal 
aperture distributions simulating a fracture aperture
were modeled using graph theory.  Flow was calculated 
through the resulting network by the Hardy Cross method.
They concluded that increasing stress reduces the 
network connectivity, that critical channels
establish percolation across the domain, and 
that flow depend on a exponent of aperture
much greater than 3.  Also, that aperture reduction
is greater than fracture flow.},
