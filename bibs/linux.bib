                 of software authors who communicate mostly by
                 electronic mail and the USENET newsgroup comp.os.linux.
                 This effort was begun by Linus Benedict Torvalds in
                 1991 as an exercise in 80386 protected mode
                 programming. From its modest beginnings as a
                 task-switcher, Linus and many contributors have built
                 Linux into a modern operating system. Linux will emerge
                 from beta testing sometime this year. The initial
                 release, which was only useful as a demonstration,
                 sparked an interest in tapping the power present in the
                 Intel 80386\slash 80486 microprocessors. The
                 development of Linux is unique in the history of
                 operating systems. The entire source code is freely
                 distributable, protected by the Free Software
                 Foundation `copyleft.' Linus Torvalds, the main author
                 and coordinator of Linux development, is available to
                 offer assistance and consider enhancements to the
                 operating system. Until now, operating system
                 development has been the province of proprietary
                 development companies and academia, which seek to
                 protect the intellectual property that they have
                 developed. This paper examines in detail the
                 cooperative development of Linux. The early history of
                 Linux reveals what inspired people to work with Linus
                 Torvalds initially. Emerging group dynamics are
                 surveyed to find how the current Linux `club' came to
                 assemble itself. The club model shows how the
                 facilities of the Internet and USENET became their
                 virtual meeting place. Analysis of current projects
                 shows how the participants divide themselves into
                 groups according to their interest, and work in these
                 interlocked circles to add to the entire effort.
                 Finally, the club model explains not only the
                 popularity of Linux, but also serves as a model for
                 future software development using electronic
                 communications.",

                 free-ware Unix for IBM 386/486 compatible computers. A
                 Linux server is inexpensive and can be set up by any
                 small college or K-12 school with access to the
                 Internet. The Softlanding Linux System (SLS)

                 including news and email servers. We look at the news
                 and email server programs that come with SLS and show

                 algorithms is measured under the Linux operating
                 system. The hardware platform is an industry standard
                 PC with an Intel 486 DX2-66 processor and a Western
                 Digital 420 Mbyte IDE disk with 128 Kbyte on-board
                 cache. The WSCAN family of scheduling algorithms is
                 seen to provide significant interaction with the
                 on-board cache, and, in particular, WSCAN(0.1) is seen
                 to deliver a 48\% reduction in mean response time
                 compared with the default Linux scheduling algorithm.
                 Simulations calibrated by trace information suggest a
                 temporal extension to WSCAN could offer further
                 improvement. The new algorithm family, XSCAN, is
                 measured on the same file-server workload, and
                 XSCAN(0.1) is seen to offer a 16\% reduction in mean
                 response time compared with WSCAN(0.1). Performance
                 comparisons on random block workloads are also provided

  abstract =     "Imake is a utility that works with make so that code
                 can automatically be configured, compiled, and
                 installed on different UNIX platforms. It is currently
                 used to configure systems such as the X Window System
                 and Kerberos authentication. Much of X's success can be
                 credited to its portability, and this portability is in
                 large part due to imake. While primarily an X tool,
                 imake is useful for any project that involves porting
                 to multiple UNIX systems. Imake generates makefiles
                 from the Imakefiles template-a set of C preprocessor
                 macros. Makefiles are generally not portable across
                 different machines. Separating machine dependencies
                 from items being built, however, renders Imakefiles
                 platform independent. imake uses Imakefiles to generate
                 a makefile for each platform for a given application.
                 It is invaluable for making a release available on a
                 wide variety of machines. The X Window System imake
                 (distributed by MIT with the standard X Window System
                 release 3 and greater) generates platform-specific
                 makefiles by using descriptions defined in Imakefiles.
                 In this article, I'Il discuss imake, its template and
                 rule files, and Imakefiles. And since imake isn't
                 restricted to X, I'll also show you how to extend
                 Imakefiles beyond the X Window System to AIX, SunOs,

                 we design a multimedia groupware system (MGS) which can

                 multimedia groupware from the workstation platform to

                 hierarchical group management system which can manage
                 many groups in the same time. We also address a fault
                 tolerant mechanism for the groupware system. We adopt
                 the multicast transport protocol to design a
                 B-multicast transport protocol which fits the
                 distributed text editor in multimedia groupware system.
                 Finally, we implement the MGS practically according to
                 our design philosophy. Experimental results show that

                 previously available on other computer controlled
                 stages. A X-windows interface under the linux operating
                 system provides a virtual instrument control panel on
                 any X-terminal connected to the global net. This allows
                 mouse driven `point and click' control over four stage
                 motions. In addition, two input channels allow
                 continuous measurement of beam current and detector
                 count rate. Each axis is controlled by a stepper motor
                 which can be configured to step in any unit. The
                 virtual instrument may be reconfigured from an
                 initialisation file to adapt to changes in the hardware
                 configuration. Motion of each axis can also be
                 controlled by a flexible command language that allows
                 for four dimensional scanning or any other complicated
                 axis movements in response to elapsed time, accumulated
                 dose or integrated detector counts. An integrated video
                 capture system provides an inset in the virtual
                 instrument control panel for viewing of the specimen in
                 real time. Some applications of this virtual instrument
                 include the identification of the orientation and

                 is being established at the University of Arkansas in
                 the Computer Systems Engineering and Electrical
                 Engineering Departments to support the undergraduate
                 and graduate network courses. The lab has 12 PCs with
                 Ethernet combination cards so that coaxial or
                 twisted-pair cables may be used. The software for the
                 lab currently consists of Novell NetWare 3.12, Novell
                 NetWare 4.1, Linux, PC-NFS, Microsoft Windows for
                 Workgroups 3.11, and Artisoft LANtastic 6.0. The
                 students set up the networks and perform various
                 exercises, including troubleshooting, administrating
                 and timing. The students also have access to a protocol
                 analyzer that can be used on the University of Arkansas
                 College of Engineering's computer network so they can
                 observe how higher traffic networks operate. The
                 College of Engineering's computer network supports PCs
                 running MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux, and Sun
                 Workstations running Solaris and SunOS. The network is
                 hooked up to the Internet as well. Students are able to
                 observe the types of packets traversing the network.
                 The analyzer was written by a Master's student and
                 includes a tutorial. A report of the success of the lab
                 and the use of the protocol analyzer is given.",

                 of portable personal computers enormously. A nomadic
                 user can be given ubiquitous access to remote
                 information stores and computing services. However, the
                 behavior of wireless links creates severe
                 inconveniences within the traditional data

                 overview of the problems related to wireless mobility.
                 We also present a new software architecture for
                 mastering them and discuss a new paradigm for designing
                 mobile distributed applications. The key idea in the

                 intelligent agent, between the mobile node and the
                 wireline network. A prototype implementation of the
                 architecture exists in an environment consisting of

  abstract =     "The practicability of high-speed communication on
                 low-end systems has frequently been questioned and even
                 less demanding variants of high-speed networking
                 standards have been developed to accommodate for the
                 restrictions of contemporary personal computers. In
                 this paper, architectural aspects of existing PC
                 hardware, ATM network adapters, and operating systems
                 are examined, and in fact, serious limitations are
                 discovered. Primarily memory bandwidth is found to be
                 insufficient to support the number of transfers
                 required by traditional networking implementation
                 designs, plus the number of further accesses required
                 for data processing by the sending or the receiving
                 application. The use of single-copy, a concept well
                 known from higher-end systems, is proposed as a means
                 to overcome the memory bandwidth bottleneck. Not only
                 usage scenarios in which single-copy can be reasonably
                 applied, but also situations in which single-copy would
                 yield only marginal improvements or where performance
                 could even deteriorate are identified. Furthermore,
                 implementation issues, such as locking of shared user
                 pages, are discussed. Finally, the performance of
                 single-copy is tested in an implementation of ATM
                 support on Linux, done at LRC, by measuring uni- and
                 bidirectional AAL5 throughput with different PDU sizes.
                 The measurement results indicate that high-speed
                 communication is feasible on today's low-end systems
                 for applications which are primarily uni-directional in
                 nature, and which respect alignment and access
                 constraints imposed by optimizations like
                 single-copy.",

                 experienced neural network user. For the novice, it
                 provides an easy-to-use neural network simulation
                 package that insulates the user from the requirements
                 of knowing the simulator implementation details or the

                 network professional it provides an interface that is
                 easily extensible to include any additional neural
                 network simulator in its binary form. To satisfy both
                 academic and personal computer environments, the GUI

                 UNIX operating system in applications which are

                 intended to be of use both for the novice and for the
                 experienced neural network user. For the novice, it
                 provides an easy-to-use neural network simulation

                 surprising capabilities. It is an interpreted
                 object-oriented scripting language and has a full range
                 of sophisticated features such as first-class
                 functions, garbage collection, and exception handling.
                 Python has properties that make it especially appealing
                 for scientific programming: Python is quite simple and
                 easy to learn, but it is a full and complete language.
                 It is simple to extend Python with your own compiled
                 objects and functions. Python is portable, from Unix to
                 Windows 95 to Linux to Macintosh. Python is free, with
                 no license required even if you make a commercial
                 product out of it. Python has a large user-contributed
                 library of ``modules''. These modules cover a wide
                 variety of needs, such as audio and image processing,
                 World Wide Web programming, and graphical user
                 interfaces. In particular, there is an interface to the
                 popular Tk package for building windowing applications.
                 And now, Python has a high-performance array module
                 similar to the facilities in specialized array
                 languages such as Matlab, IDL, Basis, or Yorick. This
                 extension also adds complex numbers to the language.
                 Array operations in Python lead to the execution of
                 loops in C, so that most of the work is done at full

                 Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris. We evaluate the systems
                 using freely available micro- and application
                 benchmarks to characterize the behavior of their
                 operating system services. We evaluate the currently

                 without any performance tuning. Our results show that
                 the x86 operating systems and system libraries we
                 tested fail to deliver the Pentium`s full memory write
                 performance to applications. On small-file workloads,
                 Linux is an order of magnitude faster than the other
                 systems. On networking software, FreeBSD provides two
                 to three times higher bandwidth than Linux. In general,
                 Solaris`s performance usually lies between that of the
                 other two systems. Although each operating system

                 no one system offers clearly better overall
                 performance. Other factors, such as extra features,

                 the user and the measurement devices. This report
                 proposes to use the capabilities of modern computer
                 systems to enable parallel and remote access to
                 measuring devices via a networked host without having
                 to use a dedicated unit to perform this task. An
                 approach is described on the basis of typical

                 provided by Emacspeak is qualitatively different from
                 what conventional screen-readers provide --- emacspeak
                 makes applications speak --- as opposed to speaking the
                 screen. Emacspeak is the first full-fledged speech
                 output system that will allow someone who cannot see to
                 work directly on a UNIX system (Until now, the only
                 option available to visually impaired users has been to
                 use a talking PC as a terminal.) Emacspeak is built on
                 top of Emacs. Once Emacs is started, the user gets
                 complete spoken feedback. I currently use Emacspeak at
                 work on my SUN SparcStation and have also used it on a
                 DECALPHA workstation under Digital UNIX while at

                 programs may be dedicated to a fixed partition, or a

                 Therefore, the MPI library has been constructed so that
                 messaging operations can be driven by polling and/or
                 interrupt techniques. It has been found that polling
                 works well when a single parallel program is running on
                 a given partition, and that interrupt-driven
                 communication makes far better use of the machine when
                 multiple parallel programs are executing. Gang

                 provide users with access to a broad set of distributed
                 resources. Unfortunately, the management overhead of
                 maintaining PC clients can become overwhelming,
                 especially with a large installed base. Popular PC
                 operating systems do not provide system administrators
                 with a set of efficient and flexible management tools
                 that can take advantage of a networked environment.
                 Unix system administrators are accustomed to having
                 such tools at their disposal to handle common
                 administration tasks, such as software upgrades,
                 initial machine installation, networked file transfer,
                 and remote backup. The paper describes the PC
                 Administration (PCADM) tools developed to provide PCs
                 with a Unix environment and robust tool set for client
                 administration purposes, without installing supporting

                 communication. Although UDP provides unreliable
                 service, it fits well with the characteristics of
                 multimedia communication. The goal of this paper is to
                 minimize the overhead of UDP for multimedia
                 communication. The overhead of UDP is dominated by
                 per-byte overhead. This paper investigates how to
                 reduce the number of data copying, which is a major
                 component of the per-byte overhead of UDP. We propose a
                 new semantics for the UDP send to eliminate data
                 copying. The implementation of the new semantics has
                 been done in the Linux operating system. Performance
                 measurements show that the new UDP send achieves better
                 throughput (over 30 percent for 4 K bytes packets) than
                 the traditional send. The results also show that the

                 (Netware File System), the Linux kernel SMBFS and NCPFS

                 virtually any file server-from Pathworks to Windows NT
                 4.0, from Netware to any NFS server-across a LAN. When
                 I was implementing SMBFS and NCPFS, however, it became
                 clear that Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB)
                 protocol is not designed to handle UNIX clients like
                 Linux. SMB, the protocol that implements file services,
                 is designed for DOS. Consequently, SMB has no notion of
                 an i-node, the central structure in every UNIX
                 filesystem implementation. On the surface, this would
                 appear to limit Linux's usefulness on heterogeneous

                 Linux applications on the Solaris 7 operating
                 environment on Intel platforms. Lxrun is a software
                 layer that sits between Solaris and the Linux Intel
                 binary executable and remaps system calls `on the fly'
                 allowing them to run unmodified on
                 Solaris.''\par

                 ``Lxrun is an emulator for executing Intel Linux a.out
                 and ELF binaries on other types of UNIX running on
                 Intel x86. It was developed originally on and for SCO
                 OpenServer and SCO UnixWare.\par

                 Lxrun does system call remapping `on the fly.' There
                 isn't a significant difference between the execution
                 environment required by Linux and SCO binaries. The
                 primary difference is the way in which system calls are
                 handled.\par

                 In Linux, an int 0x80 instruction is used, which jumps
                 to the system-call-handling portion of the Linux
                 kernel. On SCO systems, int 0x80 causes a SIGSEGV
                 signal. Lxrun intercepts these signals and calls the
                 SCO equivalent of the system call that the Linux
                 program attempted.\par

                 There is also some mapping of ioctls, various flags,
                 return values, and error codes. The result is that the
                 Linux binary runs--with the help of lxrun--on the host
                 platform with a small (usually negligible) performance
                 penalty.''",
