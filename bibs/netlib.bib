The native executable translation (NET) compiler translates java byteco-e to 
optimized native machine code.  In some cases, the translated code runs
at speeds comparable to directly compiled native code generated from a
source representation such as C or C++.
However, because the translation process in more expensive in terms of
time and space than interpretation or just-in-time compilation, only th-se
applications that are repeatedly invoked or those for which execution
time is much longer than translation time should be translated.
