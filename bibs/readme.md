# Personal BibTeX collection

This repo is a collection of BibTeX files organized by category
or subject matter. Each was manually built. The collection represents
several years effort.

Have fun!

## Todo

* organize bst files, which are bibtex style files. These shoud
probably go into a `bst` rather than `bibs` directory.
* rename template files
