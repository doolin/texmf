Most information--from a newspaper story to a temperature sensor measurement
to a Web page--is dynamic. When monitoring an information source, when do our
previous observations become stale and need refreshing? How can we schedule
these refresh operations to satisfy a required level of currency without
violating resource constraints--such as band-width or computing limitations
on how much data can be observed in a given time? \par The authors
investigate the trade-offs involved in monitoring dynamic information sources
and discuss the Web in detail, estimating how fast documents change and
exploring what constitutes a "current" Web index. For a simple class of
Web-monitoring systems--search engines--they combine their idea of currency
with actual measured data to estimate revisit rates.}

different applications have different requirements on the accuracy

the estimators, we analytically show how precise/effective the 
estimators are, and we show that the estimators
that we propose can improve precision significantly.

recently become popular for sharing information. In this paper, we 
study the relevant issues and tradeoffs in designing a scalable P2P
system. We focus on a subset of P2P systems, known as "hybrid" P2P, 
where some functionality is still centralized. (In Napster, for 
example, indexing is centralized, and file exchange is distributed.) 
We model a file-sharing application, developing a probabilistic model
to describe query behavior and expected query result sizes. We 
also develop an analytic model to describe system performance. 
Using experimental data collected from a running, publicly
available hybrid P2P system, we validate both models. We then 
present several hybrid P2P system architectures and evaluate 
them using our model. We discuss the tradeoffs between the
architectures and highlight the effects of key parameter values 
on system performance.
