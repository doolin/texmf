Below are the solutions to some common problems encountered by users:



** Slide orientation is in portrait instead of landscape when viewed in PDF

-> two possible reasons for this: you did not choose the `pdf' option
of prosper; or you have translated the PostScript file with ps2pdf
coming with GNU GhostScript. GNU GhostScript (at least v. 5.10) has
been reported to fail switching correctly the orientation. You should
upgrade to Aladdin GhostScript 6.0 or above (see also next question).


** The text of the slides in PDF is generally fine but some parts of it
and the equations are ugly. 

-> this is usually due to the fact that your file contains bitmap
fonts. Fonts in a PDF file should always be vectorial ones. Use
Aladdin GhostScript v. 60 or above (with the associated fonts) to 
translate your PostScript file. You must also ask dvips to use
vectorial fonts when creating a PostScript file from your DVI. To do
this, create the file ~/.dvipsrc with the following lines:

p +psfonts.cmz 
p +psfonts.amz 


** The slides are cropped in an odd way such that the footer is not
completely visible.

-> By default, GhostScript processes files assuming the pages are in
letter format. Prosper standard styles assume a European A4
format. You have to make GhostScript aware of the fact by using the
option

-sPAPERSIZE=a4

when you use ps2pdf. You can alternatively set the variable GS_OPTIONS
in your shell init file. E.g. in bash, put the following line in 
your ~/.bash_profile:

export GS_OPTIONS="-sPAPERSIZE=a4"


** gv is really slow to display slides when I use some particular styles.

-> Styles using gradients of colors are indeed really slow to display
and appear usually ugly with gv when the antialias is ON. Just turn it
OFF to fix the problem.
