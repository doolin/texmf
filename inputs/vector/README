The vector package provides a set of macros for more convenient
representation of vectors in LaTeX2e, both symbolically and as
implicit or explicit rows/columns of elements.

To install, simply run TeX on vector.ins, then move vector.sty to
somewhere in your TEXINPUTS path. Run LaTeX on vector.drv to
produce documentation.

Note: this is my first package for LaTeX2e. There is undoubtedly
room for improvement, and suggestions emailed to nde@dcre.leeds.ac.uk
will be gratefully received...
